In all my years at Fidelity, I don't believe I have worked with anyone that could match Mike's penchant for improving every process he touched. His dedication to and passion for technology as a solution to hurdles we face every day has proven to be a boon in my own career as it taught me how to think like a systems analyst. His knack for design should not go unmentioned because he has a true eye for intuitive and easy design. You could always tell an application/macro that was designed by Mike. I have told Mike this before, but it bears repeating: if I were starting a company tomorrow, he'd be my first call for a partner."

When he was my direct report, it was easy to give him requirements and trust he would deliver results. He demonstrated Agile methods before Agile became the trend and that goes to show how Mike is always thinking forward. As a peer and mentor in my current role, I have been able to count on him as a resource in a new working environment and, as always, a technical resource who always wants to help solve a problem. On top of being a great worker, he is a terrific teammate with whom everyone, including myself, has always enjoyed working."
