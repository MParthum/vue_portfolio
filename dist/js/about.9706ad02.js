I used Microsoft‚Äôs Power Platform in addition to SharePoint to complete this project. The business stakeholders specifically did not want to use JIRA. For ease of access to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), SharePoint was used since this service desk will live in a Microsoft Teams channel. When access to the Teams channel is granted, so is access to the underlying SharePoint site.¬†Microsoft Power Apps is how the application was built. Power Automate was leveraged to send out email notifications (with Deep Links for ease of use). Power BI is used for managers to track the service desk tickets. If I were to make changes to this application, I would have used a database rather than SharePoint. SharePoint has delegation limitations as soon as Lists contain more than 500 records. There is an option to increase the limit to 2,000 (which I did); however, this still requires maintenance of the SharePoint List to keep all functionality working properly.¬†",img:i("4ccf")},{title:"Ba Dum Tssss",type:"Web Development",link:"https://mparthum.github.io/drumkit/",github:"https://github.com/MParthum/drumkit",description:"I love music.
